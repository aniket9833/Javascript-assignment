Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

Ans: Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. They allow us to execute different code blocks depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false.

There are mainly three types of conditional statements in JavaScript:

1. if statement:
   The `if` statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

   Syntax:
   ```javascript
   if (condition) {
       // code to be executed if the condition is true
   }
   ```

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let num = 10;

   if (num > 0) {
       console.log("The number is positive.");
   }
   ```

2. if...else statement:
   The `if...else` statement executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

   Syntax:
   ```javascript
   if (condition) {
       // code to be executed if the condition is true
   } else {
       // code to be executed if the condition is false
   }
   ```

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let num = -5;

   if (num > 0) {
       console.log("The number is positive.");
   } else {
       console.log("The number is not positive.");
   }
   ```

3. if...else if...else statement:
   The `if...else if...else` statement allows you to check multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on these conditions.

   Syntax:
   ```javascript
   if (condition1) {
       // code to be executed if condition1 is true
   } else if (condition2) {
       // code to be executed if condition2 is true
   } else {
       // code to be executed if all conditions are false
   }
   ```

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let num = 0;

   if (num > 0) {
       console.log("The number is positive.");
   } else if (num < 0) {
       console.log("The number is negative.");
   } else {
       console.log("The number is zero.");
   }
   ```

These conditional statements allow developers to control the flow of the program by evaluating different conditions and executing appropriate blocks of code based on the outcomes.
