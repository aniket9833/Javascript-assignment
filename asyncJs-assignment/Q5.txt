Q5. List and briefly explain some common Browser APIs available to JavaScript developers.

ans:
Sure! Here are some common Browser APIs available to JavaScript developers:

1. DOM (Document Object Model) API
The DOM API allows to manipulate the structure, style, and content of HTML documents. You can create, remove, and modify elements dynamically.

2. Fetch API
The Fetch API provides a modern way to make network requests. It simplifies the process of fetching resources asynchronously across the network.

3. Geolocation API
This API allows to access the geographical location of the user's device. It's useful for applications that require location-based services.

4. Canvas API
The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript. It can be used for rendering 2D shapes and images, making it ideal for games and visualizations.

5. Web Storage API
This includes `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, which allow to store data in the browser. `localStorage` persists data even after the browser is closed, while `sessionStorage` only lasts for the duration of the page session.

6. Web Workers API
Web Workers allow to run scripts in background threads. This helps in performing tasks without interfering with the user interface, improving performance for complex operations.

7. WebSockets API
The WebSockets API enables real-time communication between the client and server. It's useful for applications that require instant updates, like chat apps or live feeds.

8. Service Workers API
Service Workers act as a proxy between web application and the network. They enable features like offline access, background sync, and push notifications.

9. Notifications API
This API allows web applications to display notifications to the user, even when the application is not in focus. It's useful for alerting users to important events.

10. WebRTC API
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) enables peer-to-peer communication between browsers. It's commonly used for video conferencing and file sharing.

These APIs provide powerful tools for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
